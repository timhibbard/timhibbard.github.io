		My name is Tim Hibbard, and I serve as the Vice President of Innovation and Development at Passio Technologies. Passio specializes in creating software and integrating hardware for mass transportation providers We are based in Atlanta, GA, and are a part of a larger group of companies focused on transportation, known as Transit Technologies.
</p>
<p>
My primary role at Passio is product management. I am responsible for the development of the software and services we offer. I have held this role since May 2019, when Passio acquired the company Kyle Archer and I owned, ParaPlan Software, which specialized in creating paratransit management software.
</p>
<p>
At ParaPlan Software, I served as CEO, a position I held from 2009 until the company was sold in 2019. Before becoming CEO, I had been the lead developer, software architect, and held several other titles since my initial employment with the company in 2003.
</p>
<p>
My entire career, spanning over 20 years, has been focused on public transportation. When I first started at ParaPlan (then known as EnGraph), my primary goal was to develop my technology skills; the industry I was in didn't matter at the time. However, over the years, I've come to believe that public transportation has the power to bring people together. Experiencing a city by bus or train offers an immersive experience that leads to a greater appreciation for one's environment. Incidental contact with people at bus stations or terminals is humanizing and fosters greater empathy. Not to mention the positive impact on climate change, pollution, and the reduction of traffic fatalities. 
</p>
<p>
My family and I live in Greenville, SC, which is a beautiful city in the Southeast. In 2013, we sold everything that couldn't fit into a pod and our minivan, and moved here from Kansas City after spending a weekend in the city while visiting family. Chelsea and I have been married for 15 years. She is the best ever, and all I want to do is make her laugh. We have four kids who keep our lives very busy and very full.
